A simple block to display a copyright notice with an automatically updated year.


== Description ==

The **TZM Copyright Block** is designed to streamline the display of copyright notices on websites. This plugin displays a copyright symbol with a dynamically updated year, making it ideal for users who want a set-it-and-forget-it solution to keeping copyright information accurate and current.
You can customize the copyright display to fit your needs by adding prefixes and suffixes, setting year ranges, and choosing between full-year or two-digit formats. Seamlessly integrated with the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg), this plugin ensures that setting up your copyright information is quick, easy, and requires no coding knowledge. 

It dynamically updates the year, so there’s no need to manually update the date on each page — a convenient solution for both individual sites and large-scale networks.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/tzm-copyright-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any styling options available? =

Yes, TZM Copyright Block utilizes the Block Editor’s native styling options, allowing you to adjust font, color, alignment, and more to match your website’s look and feel.

= Does this plugin work with classic themes (non-Gutenberg)? =

No, TZM Copyright Block is specifically designed for the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) and works like any other block. It is not compatible with classic themes that rely on the older Classic Editor.
